# Arcane Survival


This is a main plugin for Arcane Survival.  It contains important commands used
for the server operation.

This is the plugin that will finally get a structured and organized format.

The original code was written by Agentred100, one of two co-founders of Arcane
Survival.  It was added on by Jugglingman456, then organized by SimonOrJ.  There
are some snippets of code from Morios as well.

```
/arcanesurvival
/apply
/greylist
/help
/links
/list
```

Afk often? Here's the original AFK documentation:

***

AFK tag
* <i>/afk</i>
* shows on the TAB list
* moving, sending a message, or looking around will automatically remove the tag

***

```
/afk
```

Do you want to see how good someone's internet is? Ping them!

```
/ping
```

Or their first and last login?

```
/seen
/seenf
```

We'll still let you use /kill, which dates back to 1.8.

```
/kill
```

Well, and here's some misc command here.

```
/username
```
